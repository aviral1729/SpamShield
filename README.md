# SpamShield

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham, improving message filtering efficiency. Multiple classification algorithms were applied, with MultinomialNB achieving 97.19% accuracy and 100% precision, and BernoulliNB reaching 98.36% accuracy and 99.18% precision. Additional models like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Trees were tested and compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix.
